Discord Rich Presence for FINAL FANTASY XIV

This is my first time posting something I made on the interwebs, hope I did it good.

How to use:

Open FFXIV

Open FFXIV-discord-rpc

Ta-da! Your online status on discord should show your FFXIV character name, online status, location (hover over status), job, job level (hover over job icon)

Demo:
